# 👾 Yuvraj Joshi

**`Ambitious Coder/Developer`**


Hey there, I am Yuvraj Joshi.

I am from India, looking forward to learn and grow in this domain, my current interest are in web development and cyber security, I am familiar with programming languages like C, Python3, JavaScript, CSS, Html. (in process of adding more as each one of them costs a part of my sanity.)

One of my favorite quote is *"There's something about arriving in new cities, wandering empty streets with no destination. I will never lose the love for the arriving, but I'm born to leave.”* ~ Charlotte Eriksson, Empty Roads & Broken Bottles: in search for The Great Perhaps

 <summary><h3>🛣️ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I felt the excitement and sudden urge to conquer the world for the first time after my code compiled for a computer science project in class 11th, after that I have spent my time learning languages and having fun while coding(crying because of it as well). I aim to make a carrier out of it to get that bread for my family and hopefully develop something that can help people and leave a mark on earth or maybe mars, who knows what the future holds.
